# Smart-Kitchen-Automation

We will build an IoT Based Smart Kitchen with Automation & Monitoring System using NodeMCU ESP8266. The kitchen is one of the important places in a house. The safety factor is the main aspect that must be taken into account during the activity in the kitchen. The existence of gas leakage, uncontrolled fire, excessive temperatures & a moist environment must be quickly identified and addressed. Apart from this, it is necessary to monitor & control Kitchen Appliances like lights, fridge, oven, etc remotely. The main motto of this project is to make a prototype of an IoT Based Smart Kitchen using the Internet of Things. The system uses multiple sensors, relays & NodeMCU ESP8266 Board. We can monitor all the sensor data on Blynk Applications. We can also send the command from Blynk App to control Kitchen Appliances.
